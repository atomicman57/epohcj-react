# Observations
* Contents shouldn't get to the both ends of the screen in desktop/tablet views. In bootstrap, I'll simply say; "Use 'container' and not 'container-fluid'".
* Give "Login" and "Register" links at the nav a different color as shown in mock.
* Add a space before/after the "search icon" which a text field should slide left when clicked.
* The "tabs" section, where we have "Albums, Playlist, Status, Option 4" should have a background color, and not just an underline.
* You didn't add the "Also Featured in" section
* See how "tag" section is structured in mock. Same design as the "tabs" section nav.
* Add padding below text in footer. More like, text should be vertically aligned.
* Website color is; #00A755
