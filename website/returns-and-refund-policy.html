<h2>RETURNS AND REFUNDS</h2>
<p>You may return any products you have purchased within 24 hours of delivery for amends as we do not guarantee users 100% money back except under a very exceptional scenario like;</p>
<ol>
	<li>Undelivered products due to robbery</li>
	<li>Poor handling by carrier</li>
	<li>Deceptive material </li>
	<li>Product is not what you ordered</li>
	<li>Product do not meet your order prescription</li>
	<li>Damage on product at point of delivery</li>
</ol>
<p>To do so you must notify us in writing or other durable medium (including e-mail) within 24 hours. You will then be entitled to refund from us, which will be paid as soon as possible. You must arrange for and pay the cost of returning the products to us. On request we will collect the products from you, but the cost of this will be charged to you and we may deduct this from the refund. While in your possession, you must keep any product you intend to return to us in good condition.</p>
<p>If the product delivered is not what you ordered, or does not correspond with its description; the product delivered is not of a satisfactory quality; or the product is not fit for any other purpose for which you have bought it and you notified us in writing of this purpose before accepting the delivery, and we have not informed you that the product is not fit for that purpose, we will at our option deliver to you a replacement product or refund to you the price paid and your reasonable costs of returning the products.</p>
<p>Unless faulty, we are unable to accept the returns of underwear. swimwear is only returnable if unworn, with the hygiene strip and original label in place. If exchanging items and the value is greater than that of the one you are returning additional payment will be required.</p>
<p>If you have any enquiries or complaints, you should direct them to us via e-mail at support@phantfashion.com  or call our customer service on +2348032701360</p>
